title: The API Stack
---
<p>These are the APIs I am tracking on and profiling. I'm working to profile them using APIs.json, OpenAPI, and with Postman Collections. Working to make the API sector more discoverable, and executiable using common machine readable API discovery formats.</p>
<p>I'll be adding other "stacks" of APIs in different verticals, as I update them. Making them available in the left-hand navigation, allowing for easier browsing of the best of the APIs I am studying as part of my research.</p>
{% assign number_of_orgs = 0 %}
<table width="100%">
  {% for item in site.data.apis.include %}
    {% assign number_of_orgs = number_of_orgs + 1 %}
    <tr>
      <td width="70%">{{ item.name }}</td>
      <td><a href="https://{{ item.url | replace: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-stack-providers/','' | replace: '/master/_apisjson/apis.yaml','' | replace: '-','.' }}.stack.network/">Website</a></td>
      <td><a href="{{ item.url }}">APIs.json</a></td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/api-stack-providers/{{ item.url | replace: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/api-stack-providers/','' | replace: '/master/_apisjson/apis.yaml','' }}">Github</a></td>
    </tr>
  {% endfor %}

<p>This project runs 100% on Github, and you <a href="github.com/api-stack/api-stack">can access via its Github repository</a>, with a machine readable APIs.json index available for all for the organizations, and APIs included in this stack. You can access all repositories using the master APIs.json collections for this work, with each individual service provider operating as its own Github repository.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that this is my workbench for profiling APIs, and it is all a work in progress. If you are integrating with, and consuming API definitions, it is up to you to build in healthy practices for keeping in sync, and complete within your own definition.</p>
