description: Stack Exchange is a network of question and answer websites on diverse
  topics in many different fields, each site covering a specific topic, where questions,
  answers, and users are subject to a reputation award process. The sites are modeled
  after Stack Overflow, a forum for computer programming questions that was the original
  site in this network. The reputation system is designed to allow the sites to be
  self-moderating.
